# Credit Card Approval with Artificial Intelligence
AI Banking - Automated credit card approval with a predictive model for commercial banks. 


## Description
*Data Camp* project for deploying an automated system of credit card approval. It looks at data containing loan balances, income levels, individual credit reports, amongst other customer data. Automatization is useful in this case because manually analyzing every application is error-prone and time consuming.  It is a  project to show proficiency in **cleaning datasets**, dealing with **missing values**, as well as **manipulating data** and **supervised learning techniques**. 

## Data
The data for this project was scraped from the [UCI Machine Learning repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval). The data files are as follows:

- **cc_approvals.data**: credit card applications data. All attribute names and values have been changed to meaningless symbols to protect confidentiality of the data. Interesting dataset due to the good mix of attributes: continuous, nominal with small numbers of values, and nominal with larger numbers of values. There are also a few missing values.


## Notebook
The notebook comprehends the whole project and is self-contained when the datasets are loaded. Each of its 12 steps has a description on what is being done in the section.
